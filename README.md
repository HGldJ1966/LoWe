The goal of this project is to extend the current functionality of Ubuntu on Windows. Reliability, UX, functionality improvements are expected in the future.

Feedback is welcome.

#### Firefox on Window Maker on X.Org on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

With LoWe it's possible to run X programs without employing any third-party X servers.

It's a bit buggy, but works.
